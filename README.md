# Welcome To My Cat Api App Github Page!

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

#### In order to be able to use your website, a .env file needs to be created.
#### Within the file, a "REACT_APP_CAT_API_KEY" needs to be added along with your API key.
#### For example:
#### REACT_APP_CAT_API_KEY="Your Api Key"
#### If that doesn't work, you can simply replace "process.env.REACT_APP_CAT_API_KEY" found on line 6 of ImageGen.js with your API key.

#### Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!
